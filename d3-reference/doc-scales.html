					<h3>Scales (v3)</h3>
					<p>“Scales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range.”</p>
					<p>That’s Mike Bostock’s definition of D3 scales.</p>
					<p>The values in any data set are unlikely to correspond exactly to pixel measurements for use in your visualization. Scales provide a convenient way to map those data values to new values useful for visualization purposes.</p>
					<p>D3 scales are functions whose parameters you define. Once they are created, you call the scale function, pass it a data value, and it nicely returns a scaled output value. You can define and use as many scales as you like.</p>
					<p>It may be tempting to think of a scale as something that appears visually in the final image — like a set of tick marks, indicating a progression of values. Do not be fooled! Those tick marks are part of an axis, which is essentially a visual representation of a scale. A scale is a mathematical relationship, with no direct visual output. I encourage you to think of scales and axes as two different, yet related, elements.</p>
					<p>This topic addresses only linear scales, since they are most common and understandable. Once you understand linear scales, the others will be a piece of cake.</p>

					<h4>Apples and Pixels</h4>
					<p>Imagine that the following data set represents the number of apples sold at a roadside fruit stand each month:</p>
					<pre>var dataset = [ 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 ]</pre>
					<p>First of all, this is great news, as the stand is selling 100 additional apples each month! Business is booming. To showcase this success, you want to make a bar chart illustrating the steep upward climb of apple sales, with each data value corresponding to the height of one bar.</p>
					<p>Until now, we’ve used data values directly as display values, ignoring unit differences. So if 500 apples were sold, the corresponding bar would be 500 pixels tall.</p>
					<p>That could work, but what about next month, when 600 apples are sold? And a year later, when 1,800 apples are sold? Your audience would have to purchase ever-larger displays, just to be able to see the full height of those very tall apple-bars!</p>
					<p>This is where scales come in. Because apples are not pixels (which are also not oranges), we need scales to translate between them.</p>

					<h4>Domains and Ranges</h4>
					<p>A scale’s <strong>input domain</strong> is the range of possible input data values. Given the apples data above, appropriate input domains would be either 100 and 500 (the minimum and maximum values of the data set) or zero and 500.</p>
					<p>A scale’s <strong>output range</strong> is the range of possible output values, commonly used as display values in pixel units. The output range is completely up to you, as the information designer. If you decide the shortest apple-bar will be 10 pixels tall, and the tallest will be 350 pixels tall, then you could set an output range of 10 and 350.</p>
					<p>For example, create a scale with an input domain of 100,500 and an output range of 10,350. If you gave that scale the value 100, it would return 10. If you gave it 500, it would spit back 350. If you gave it 300, it would hand 180 back to you on a silver platter. (300 is in the center of the domain, and 180 is in the center of the range.)</p>

					<h4>Normalization</h4>
					<p>If you’re familiar with the concept of normalization, it may be helpful to know that, with a linear scale, that’s all that is really going on here.</p>
					<p>Normalization is the process of mapping a numeric value to a new value between 0 and 1, based on the possible minimum and maximum values. For example, with 365 days in the year, day number 310 maps to about 0.85, or 85% of the way through the year.</p>
					<p>With linear scales, we are just letting D3 handle the math of the normalization process. The input value is normalized according to the domain, and then the normalized value is scaled to the output range.</p>

					<h4>Creating a Scale</h4>
					<p>D3’s scale generators are accessed with d3.scale followed by the type of scale you want.<p>
					<pre>var scale = d3.scale.linear();</pre>
					<p>Now scale is a function to which you can pass input values. (Don’t be misled by the var above; remember that in JavaScript, variables can store functions.)<p>
					<pre>scale(2.5);  //Returns 2.5</pre>
					<p>Since we haven't set a domain and a range yet, this function is mapping input to output on a 1:1 scale. That is, whatever we input will be returned unchanged.<p>

					<p>We can set the scale’s input domain to 100,500 by passing those values to the domain() method as an array:</p>
					<pre>scale.domain([100, 500]);</pre>
					<p>Set the output range in similar fashion, with range():</p>
					<pre>scale.range([10, 350]);</pre>
					<p>These steps can be done separately, as above, or chained together into one line of code:</p>
					<pre>var scale = d3.scale.linear()
  .domain([100, 500])
  .range([10, 350]);</pre>
					<p>Either way, our scale is ready to use!</p>
					<pre>scale(100);  //Returns 10
  scale(300);  //Returns 180
  scale(500);  //Returns 350</pre>
					<p>Typically, you will call scale functions from within an attr() method or similar, not on their own.</p>

					<h4>Scaling the Scatterplot</h4>
					<p>To revisit our data set from the scatterplot:</p>
					<pre>var dataset = [
  [5, 20], [480, 90], [250, 50], [100, 33], [330, 95],
  [410, 12], [475, 44], [25, 67], [85, 21], [220, 88]
];</pre>
					<p>You’ll recall that dataset is an array of arrays. We mapped the first value in each array onto the x axis, and the second value onto the y axis. Let’s start with the x axis.</p>
					<p>Just by eyeballing the x values, it looks like they range from 5 to 480, so a reasonable input domain to specify might be 0,500, right?</p>

					<p>Instead of specifying fixed values for the domain, we can use convenient array functions like min() and max() to analyze our data set on the fly. For example, this loops through each of the x values in our arrays and returns the value of the greatest one:</p>
					<pre>d3.max(dataset, function(d) {    //Returns 480
	return d[0];  //References first value in each sub-array
});</pre>
					<p>Putting it all together, let’s create the scale function for our x axis:</p>
					<pre>var xScale = d3.scale.linear()
  .domain([0, d3.max(dataset, function(d) { return d[0]; })])
  .range([0, w]);</pre>
